# Concord Individual Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Concord** (the "Project"),
maintained by the Concord contributors (the "Maintainers"). This Contributor
License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to
the Project.

By signing this Agreement (via the CLA bot on your pull request), you accept and
agree to the following terms and conditions for your present and future
contributions submitted to the Project.

## 1. Definitions

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any
modifications or additions to an existing work, that you intentionally submit to
the Project for inclusion. "Submit" means any form of electronic communication
sent to the Project, including but not limited to pull requests, issues, commits,
and comments on the Project's GitHub repository.

**"You" (or "Your")** means the individual or legal entity making the
Contribution. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other
entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that
entity are considered to be a single Contributor.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you hereby grant to the
Maintainers and to recipients of software distributed by the Maintainers a
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions and such
derivative works.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you hereby grant to the
Maintainers and to recipients of software distributed by the Maintainers a
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
transfer the Contribution, where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution(s) alone or
by combination of your Contribution(s) with the Project to which such
Contribution(s) were submitted.

## 4. You Represent That:

(a) Each Contribution is your original creation, or you have sufficient rights to
submit it under this Agreement.

(b) Your Contribution does not violate any third party's intellectual property
rights or any applicable law.

(c) If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that
includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to
make Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that your employer has waived
such rights for your Contributions to the Project.

(d) You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If your employer(s) has
rights to intellectual property that you create, you have received permission to
make the Contribution on behalf of that employer, or your employer has waived
such rights.

## 5. Support; Warranty Disclaimer

You are not expected to provide support for your Contributions, except to the
extent you desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a
fee, or not at all.

**UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, YOU PROVIDE YOUR
CONTRIBUTIONS ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.**

## 6. Retention of Rights

You retain all right, title, and interest in your Contributions. This Agreement
does not transfer copyright ownership — it is a license grant only.

## 7. Notification

You agree to notify the Maintainers of any facts or circumstances of which you
become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
